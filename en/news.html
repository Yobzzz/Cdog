							<h2>CDOG Introduction</h2>
							<p class="text-secondary" align="left">
								
						
								<b>1.&nbsp;Basics</b><br>
								 <br>
								CDOG tributes to Satoshi Nakamoto and Dogecoin.<br>
								There is no WhitePaper, no technical route, no planning and operation, and no project parties. What we have is just the CDOG community. CDOG is now decentralized. The larger the community, the more decentralized it will be. There is no project party, all permissions of the contract address zerotoone.en are destroyed. Thus, No one can change the path to complete the decentralization of CDOG.<br>
								<br>
								 We don't know which programmer was on a whim one day and issued a coin on EOS, named CDOG.
								 <br
								CDOG is a community experimental project that is born towards 100% decentralization. It uses the EOS public chain as its parent. The goal is to allow EOS to nurture CDOG and CDOG to nurture EOS. The total number of hairstyles is 10,000,000,000,000 (100 thousand trillion). After the project started, 50% will be sent directly to the EOS black hole address (tribute to Satoshi Nakamoto), and the remaining 50% will be invested in the DeFis EOS:CDOG pot. CDOG is to be an all-round decentralized community. CDOG can be used as a scenario for any landing and marketing. The promoter can repurchase the CDOG and destroy it. In this way, the value of CDOG is continuously improved for the community.
								 <br>
								<b>2.&nbsp;Evolution</b><vr>
								 <br>
								(1) CDOG went online on April 21, 2021. The total amount of 100 thousand trillion, 5.478 thousand trillion of the total has been destroyed, and the remaining 4.522 thousand trillion will be invested in DeFis EOS’s CDOG pool. The project party has no reservations. The project party left after handing it over to the top man. Because there are very few EOS in the initial pairing of mining, anyone who knows how to mine knows that it means that CDOG's currency price is almost zero. At that time, you could buy most of the CDOGs of the entire plate with just a few eos. Of course, even if you buy them all, it is worth only a few dollars, because the entire CDOG market value is only a few hundred or a few thousand dollars.<br>
								 <br>
								(2) Current price: 1 EOS = 2.5 trillion CDOG, with a market value of 700 thousand dollars. At present, the number of CDOG mining accounts of the project party is about 4000 trillion. The number of CDOG at the end of all mining accounts is about 13000 trillion. Some people may ask, isn't 45.22 thousand trillion invested in market making? Why is there only 13 thousand trillion yuan, and where is the 32 thousand trillion?<br>
								Because people are constantly buying CDOGs, the number of CDOGs that the project party's EOS/CDOG pool is getting smaller and smaller (which also means that CDOG price is getting higher and higher). And for those who buy CDOGs, many of their CDOGs have not invested in mining. In other words, these coins are scattered among various people.<br>
								 <br>
								(3) Using only need 30 dollars, you can buy 1/1000 of the chips.<br>
								Participate in small purchases, do not stud, and preach more. (It is recommended to buy 0.5 EOS value of CDOG, and then add it to the DeFis EOS/CDOG pool by mining). Therefore the risk is small and it is also in line with the CDOG trend to completely decentralize. The path of globalization has allowed more and more small-sum self-employed to participate in market making and provide active pool to achieve complete decentralization. Let CDOG become the next legend in the currency circle, and you will participate in the uprising!

								EOS/CDOG pair<br>
								USDT/CDOG pair<br>
								 <br>
								(4) At present, an enthusiastic group mainly composed of enthusiasts of CDOG currency promotes and operates, and enthusiasts donate to CDOG to establish a promotion fund.<br>
								 <br>
								(5) The promotion method is mainly through giving coins to encourage participation in cdog coin holding and market making.<br>
								 <br>
								<b>3.&nbsp;Project Analyse</b><br>
								 <br>
								In the future, with more and more people participating, the market value will only continue to grow, there will be ups and downs, and there will be repetitions, but the general direction must be more and more participants. The market value is getting higher and higher, it's just a matter of speed. <br> In this sense, when buying cdog, the general trend will only rise, not fall. <br> The rate of increase is directly related to the rate of popularization. <br> Moreover, the CDOG community has now established a fund committee. Everyone collects donations and community members have their own evangelism. They want to build CDOG into a new traffic platform. Later, the project will be profitable. All profits will be repurchased and CDOG will be destroyed. <br>
								 <br><br>
								<b>4.&nbsp;Social Significance</b><br>
								 <br>
								No one knows which programmer came up on a whim and issued a coin on EOS named as CDOG.<br>
								It is an interesting social experiment for those reasons below:<br>
								1.&nbsp;There is no real project party for this project, only some good guys handed out a coin to do social experiments. And they basically no longer participate. (SATOSHI NAKAMOTO)<br>
								2.&nbsp;There are no winners or losers in this project, only fans come in and out, come and go freely. (Decentralized)<br>
								3.&nbsp;At first, everyone dismissed it. But when the popularity spread, it was rushed. (Bitcoin)<br>
								Think about it together, and you will find that this coin is a social experiment that truly adheres to the concept of decentralization.<br>
								But few people understand this.<br>
								An experiment as it is.<br>
								An experiment as it will always be.<br>
								 <br>
								<b>5. How to participate?</b><br>
								 <br>
								Spend several dollars, buy a few EOS or USDT, replace half of it with CDOG, and do mining with the other half of EOS or USDT. Don't worry about it anymore. Let its value grow slowly. It's that simple.<br>
